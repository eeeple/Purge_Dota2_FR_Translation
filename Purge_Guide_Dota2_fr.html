<h1>Bienvenue dans Dota, tu crains</h1>

<p>
	<!-- Welcome to Dota, you su... well actually you guys have gotten a lot better.-->
	Bienvenue dans Dota, tu cra... bon en fait, vous êtes devenus bien meilleurs.
</p>

	<!-- I've been happily forced to rewrite my guide because the problems of the new Dota 2 player are very different than the problems of the DotA 1 player when I originally wrote the guide in 2011. In short, the tools that Valve provided and the learning resources that the community has created are very different than they were in the past. I also think that I can write a better guide now than I could then. -->
	J'ai été plaisamment obligé de réécrire ce guide car les problèmes rencontrés par les nouveaus joueurs de Dota 2 sont vraiment différents des problèmes rencontrés en 2011 par les joueurs de Dota 1, quand j'ai écrit ce guide pour la première fois. En fait, les outils fournis par Valve et les différentes ressources créées par la communauté sont très différents de ce qu'ils étaient dans le passé. Je pense aussi que je suis capable d'écrire un meilleur guide maintenant qu'à l'époque.

	<!-- Before we start, I just want to thank you for taking a chance on this game. It takes a long time to refine your skills and learn, but that's often the most rewarding part about playing Dota 2. If you're here because your friends want you to play with them, then that social aspect is made easier by trying to fix your new player mistakes, or at least giving you a foundation that will help you see and correct your errors. Lets see if we can keep those to a minimum.-->

	Avant que l'on commence, je tiens juste à vous remercier d'avoir essayé Dota. Apprendre et s'améliorer peuvent prendre très longtemps, mais c'est souvent la chose la plus gratifiante lorsque l'on joue à Dota 2. Si vous avez atterri ici parce que vos amis veulent que vous jouiez avec eux, tout sera plus facile si vous corrigez vos erreurs de débutant ou tout du moins si vous avez des bases qui vous aideront à voir ces erreurs et à les corriger. Essayons de voir si on peut les limiter au maximum.

<h2>Les bases de Dota</h2>
<p>
	<!-- Dota 2 is a five versus five team game. You win the game by destroying your enemy's Ancient building also known as the Throne before the enemy team destroys yours. -->
	Dota 2 est un jeu en équipe de 5 contre 5. Le but du jeu est de détruire le bâtiment principal de l'ennemi, appelé "Ancien" ("Ancient" en anglais) ou "Trône" ("Throne" en anglais) avant qu'il ne détruise le vôtre.
</p>
<!-- TODO: Add image -->
<p>
	<!-- At the start of the game every hero is weak, with little experience and little gold. Experience gives you levels and access to stronger skills, and Gold buys you items that make you do a variety of things, like run faster, do more damage, and cast special spells. -->
	Au début du jeu, tous les héros sont faibles, avec très peu d'expérience et d'or. Ceux-ci gagnent des niveaux et débloquent de puissantes capacités en gagnant de l'expérience. L'or, quant à lui, vous permet d'acheter des objets qui vous permettent, entre autres, de vous déplacer plus vite, de faire plus de dégats ou d'invoquer des sorts spéciaux.
</p>

<p>
	<!-- Your goal is to spend your time gaining exp and gold as fast as possible, or assisting your team in doing so while limiting and reducing your opponents' exp and gold gain. If you gain a significant exp and gold advantage by the later stages of the game, it usually allows your team to destroy all heroes in your path, followed immediately by buildings, and ultimately finish killing the enemy Ancient, upon which you win the game. How you go about doing this is playing Dota. -->
	Votre objectif est de gagner de l'expérience et de l'or le plus rapidement possible, ou d'aider votre équipe tout en réduisant les gains d'expérience et d'or de vos ennemis. Si vous avez un gros avantage en terme d'or et d'expérience dans les dernières minutes de la partie, cela permet généralement à votre équipe de se débarasser de tous les héros en travers de votre chemin, puis des bâtiments et enfin, de détruire le bâtiment principal ennemi, l'"Ancient", afin de gagner la partie. Pour y arriver, il suffit de jouer à Dota.
</p>
<p>
	<!-- Lets start off with some more basics. -->
	Commençons par les bases.
</p>

<h2>Creeps</h2>

<p>
	<!-- There are three lanes that spawn creeps every 30 seconds at the :00 and :30 mark for the entire game. These creeps run down each lane for both teams and attack each other until they die. You want to be close by for that because when your enemies' creeps die, they release experience for your team in the area. -->
	Il y a 3 couloirs ("lanes" en anglais)
</p>
<p>
To move your hero to go to these lanes, you select your hero by left clicking on your hero and then right click the ground to move your hero to that position. If there is an enemy where you right click, you will issue an attack command, which means your hero will move to that target and attack when in range. All heroes have a basic attack that is often called a right click or right clicking. This is the main way that you do damage, especially in the early game. Most heroes do a low amount of right click damage in the early game because their levels are low and you have little gold to purchase expensive and strong items.

If you are the hero that does the final damaging blow to kill a creep (called the last hit), then you also get gold! If you do not get the last hit, you only get experience, assuming that you are close enough. This is the first thing that you will have to practice to become a better than average Dota player. Learn to get the last hit on a creep so that you get gold in addition to exp. In addition to last hitting, every player gets 5 gold every 3 seconds just by being in the game. However, last hitting is still extremely important because if you can last hit more often than your opponents, you will help your team get the gold advantage that allows you to buy the items that win you the fights that wins you the game.

This may make you think that this allows you and your opponent to stand in the same lane, but your opponent can attack their creeps when they get below half of their Health Points (HP) by pressing the 'A' key for attack and then left clicking their creeps. If they last hit one of their creeps instead of you, it's called a deny and an exclamation(!) point will appear over their head, showing that the creep was denied. When a creep is denied, it gives less experience than it would have, and there is no chance to receive the gold bounty. You don’t get the gold yourself from denying, but preventing them from getting full exp and any gold is worth the effort.



This creates a scenario where the player who is better at last hitting will get more gold and experience than their opponents, so do your best to focus and last hit for the first advantage in the game.

Being in one of the 3 lanes in the early game is important because of the gold and exp gain, but there are more places you can farm such as neutral camps, which are the many areas where neutral creeps spawn and sit. They can be farmed by either team, and the main locations of these neutral creeps are in the heavily forested regions on the map also known as the Jungle. There are very few heroes in Dota 2 that can gain gold and experience in the jungle at the start of the game because the creeps are stronger than regular creeps, but if your hero is one of those heroes, it's often worth it to put 1 hero in the jungle to start the game.

To sum up the very beginning of the game, heroes are distributed to each lane depending on their role and then do their best to get last hits and exp while limiting their opponents last hits by denying as well as some other advanced methods.

My favorite advanced method to deny your opponents of gold and exp gain while enhancing yours is to Kill Them.

You will get opportunities to attack enemy heroes (called harassing) while you are laning, but that mostly depends on the hero matchups. Matchups in reference to the laning stage (early game) means what heroes you are playing, and what heroes your opponents decided to put in a lane against you.

If your opponent is playing a melee hero (a hero whose right click is very short range) and you are playing a ranged hero (a hero whose right click is a long ranged projectile like an arrow) then you have many opportunities to harass your opponent when they go for last hits. If you harass your opponent enough and his HP becomes too low, it may give you an opportunity to use your skills to slow, damage, or stun (preventing any action) your opponent and Kill Them. If you are the one getting harassed, make sure that you use your consumable HP regeneration items that you purchased at the start of the game to keep your hp full after you take damage so that the damage required to kill you is increased.  I’ll tell you which ones to buy later.

If you kill your opponent in lane or throughout the game, you accomplish a few things. First, your opponent isn't in lane anymore because all dead heroes are removed from the map for a set time depending on their level, and after they respawn, they have to walk back to the lane from base. Any exp and gold from creeps that die while they're gone is wasted. Second, you gain exp and gold for being present at their death, and that should make you a higher level, making your skills and right click stronger than your opponent.

With that advantage you just got, it becomes easier to kill them again, and again. This is called snowballing. You gain a small advantage, and you use that to take another advantage, and another advantage. One way to stop snowballs is by killing the player who is snowballing since you get extra gold from a wealthy hero, or a hero who is on a kill streak!

Keep in mind that snowballing might be because of you. If you repeatedly die (also known as 'Feeding' your opponent gold) then you are allowing your opponents to get an advantage and snowball. DO NOT FEED. You want to maximize kills on your opponents, get last hits and exp from creeps and in the meantime minimize your deaths. To avoid feeding, if your opponents are trying to kill you and you think you will lose the fight, it's generally best to throw your stun or slow (if you have one) and IMMEDIATELY run straight towards the nearest tower.

My second favorite advanced method to deny your opponents of gold and exp gain while enhancing yours is to Almost Kill Them.

By Almost Killing Them, you put their life at such a low point that they will be forced to run back to their fountain (which regenerates your health points (HP) and mana points (MP)). They will only go back if they are out of regen items, so it's much better if you kill them instead. If they do run back to their fountain they are wasting time, as creeps are dying without giving exp, creeps are not being last hit, and no one is around to deny you while you are last hitting, which gives you more gold and exp. This is not nearly as good as when you Kill Them, but it's better than nothing.
